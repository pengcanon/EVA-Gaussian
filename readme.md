# EVA-Gaussian: 3D Gaussian-Based Real-time Human Novel View Synthesis Under Diverse Camera Settings

Welcome to the official code repository for **EVA-Gaussian**! This project implements the methods proposed in the paper "EVA-Gaussian: 3D Gaussian-Based Real-time Human Novel View Synthesis Under Diverse Camera Settings."

## Project Overview

This project provides a 3D Gaussian-based approach for real-time human novel view synthesis, applicable under diverse camera settings. Our method is capable of generating high-quality human images from different viewpoints, with a wide range of potential applications.

## Open Source Plan

We plan to open source this code repository in **December**. At that time, you will be able to access the complete code and usage instructions to implement our methods in your projects.

Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your support and interest!
